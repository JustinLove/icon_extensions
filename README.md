# Icon Extensions

Allows you to see additional custom strategic icons from compatible server mods.

Since it's meant to server as a sort of universal client mod for server mods, it also includes a hook to reload the game lobby when required for UI updates.

Mod authors: see Icon Reloader; this greatly increases the unused icon pool.

Trivia: PA can display at most 315 strategic icons. `315*52` is suspiciously close to 2^14, so it may be a texture size limit.
